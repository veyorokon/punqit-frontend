### Tech

punq uses a number of open source and free tier projects to work properly:

* [ReactJS] - Front end JS framework.
* [Django] - Backend framework built with python.
* [npm] - Package manager for installing ReactJS modules.

### Local Installation & Development

punq requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v12.5.0+ to run.

Install the frontend dependencies and start the `frontend` server. Open a new terminal and run:

```sh
$ npm install -d
$ npm start
```

Verify this by navigating to localhost port 3000 in your web browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:3000
```

To stop the `frontend`, go back to the terminal window running it. Then, press `control + c`.


### For production environments...

```sh
$ Install instructions needed.
```
